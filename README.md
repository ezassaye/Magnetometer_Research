Magnetometer Senior Design 

Modern smartphones are equipped with highly accurate magnetometer sensors that can precisely sample the intensity and direction of the magnetic field surrounding the device. This project seeks to investigate the capabilities of smartphone magnetometer sensors to capture electromagnetic emanations generated by nearby electronic devices and determine whether these emanations can be analyzed to infer the activities of said devices. The successful execution of this project will provide valuable insights into the potential privacy and security risks associated with the use of smartphone magnetometer sensors.
